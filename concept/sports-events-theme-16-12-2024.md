# Sport's events theme for card collecting game

## 16-12-2024

### Distribution between sports
By ChatGPT, the most dominant activites on Strava should be running and cycling. Next are swimming, hiking, walking and gym based activities.

Building on this premise, we can categorize our events into the following general categories:
- Marathons
- Ultra marathons
- Amateur MTB events
- Amateur road cycling events
- Gravel events
- Professional bike races
- Ironmans, Triathlons (bonus category)
- Extreme bike events (liek Avalanche; also bonus category)

### The final count of cards?
It is maybe better to start with less as in EV. When we count with also achievements and silver/gold/platinum tiering of each card - it is maybe better to lower the number of cards in collection. Maybe 80-100 is enough.

### Distribution idea
