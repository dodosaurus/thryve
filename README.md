## Initial vision of the project

Mobile game integrated with the Strava API, with a core gameplay loop centered around building and nurturing a virtual garden. 

The game has a pixelated, top-down aesthetic and allows players to:

- Earn in-game currency by recording physical activities on Strava.
- Use the currency to purchase seeds and decorations from an in-game shop.
- Plant seeds and grow plants that develop over time (days, weeks, or months depending on the plant type).

The game operates on seasons:

- A new garden begins every year, where players start fresh.
- Previous gardens are archived in a "hall of fame" for viewing and limited modifications.
- Has social element where players can visit each other's gardens, encouraging community interaction.
